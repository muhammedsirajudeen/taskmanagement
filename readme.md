# Task Assignment Application

## Overview
The Task Assignment Application is a task management system with a calendar interface. The application allows Managers to create, assign, and manage tasks for Employees under their supervision. Employees can view their assigned tasks and complete them accordingly. Additionally, all created tasks are also integrated with Google Calendar events for better tracking.

## Features

### Authentication
- Secure user authentication system.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with two roles:
  - **Employee**: Can only view assigned tasks.
  - **Manager**: Can create, update, assign, and delete tasks for Employees under them.
- Managers can act as their own managers as well.

### Task Management
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
- **Managers** can:
  - Click on the calendar interface to create new tasks.
  - Assign tasks to Employees.
  - Update or delete tasks.
  - View all tasks for Employees on a selected day.
- **Employees** can:
  - View only the tasks assigned to them.

### Calendar Interface
- Interactive calendar-based task management system.
- Similar UI/UX to Google Calendar or Outlook.
- Easy task scheduling by selecting a date.

### Google Calendar Integration
- When creating a task, it is automatically added as an event in **Google Calendar**.
- This ensures seamless tracking and synchronization with personal calendars.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB
